Our crypto currency lubricates the ecosystem and serves as payment for interactions at predetermined intervals. Enterprise and non-enterprise users can interact with our Eco-system via our app and web-based solutions across different platforms for free. Adabase while built to work with Adashe can via smart contracts execute payments for other chains with associated fees. Furthermore, Adashe plans to eventually run on its own custom blockchain protocol.",
